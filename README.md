Branch- When you create a repository with content on GitHub, GitHub creates the repository with a single branch. This first branch in the repository is the default branch. The default branch is the branch that GitHub displays when anyone visits your repository.

Clone- Image result for clone github. Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project

Commit- It is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when.

Fetch- Downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repositroy

Git- An open-source, version control tool created in 2005 by developers working on the Linux operating system

Github- A Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface

Merge- Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.

Merge Conflict- Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file

Push- The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repoistory

Pull- Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub

Remote- A remote repository in Git, also called a remote, is a Git repository that's hosted on the Internet or another network

Repository- A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository
